Pharo: The immersive programming experience
	http://pharo.org/

Last Update: Octobre 2017

Pharo is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback (think IDE and OS rolled into one).

Simple & powerful language
	No constructors, no types declaration, no interfaces, no primitive types. Yet a powerful and elegant language with a full syntax fitting in one 
	postcard! Pharo is objects and messages all the way down.

Feel a live environment
	Feel the joy of having immediate feedback at any moment of your development: Developing, testing, debugging. Even in production environments, you 	will never be stuck in compiling and deploying steps again!

Amazing debugging experience
	The Pharo environment includes a debugger unlike anything you've seen before. It allows you to step through code, restart the execution of methods, 	create methods on the fly, and much more!

Pharo is yours
	Pharo is made by an incredible community, with more than 80 contributors for the last revision of the platform and hundreds of people contributing 
	constantly with frameworks and libraries.
